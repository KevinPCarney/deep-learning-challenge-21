This homework involved reviewing a csv called "Charity.csv".  After preprocessing the data we needed to run the notebook in google collab and work to train neural networks on their ability to predict whether a charity campaign would be successful.  4 neural networks were created with different parameters and activations to attempt to achieve 75% predictive accuracy for the network.
